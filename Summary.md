# Earnings Call Sentiment Analysis


This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on earnings call transcripts. The project involves scraping earnings call transcripts from the Seeking Alpha website and processing them to extract relevant information such as company name, ticker symbol, and sentiment. The sentiment analysis is performed using a pre-trained machine learning model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The project also includes visualizations of the sentiment analysis results and a dashboard for exploring the data. The README file provides instructions on how to set up and run the project.
